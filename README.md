Desktop app to display collected info from kml file (mainly MyTrack by Google).

## Goals
- Get accurate distance calculation (taking in account vertical component).
- More possibility to display information like total distance of the records over chosen period of time.
- Possibility to amend missing information by manualy adding distance and time.

##Reasons
I recently discover that MyTrack doesn't take in account the vertical distance in the calculation of distance. In other words, it works in 2d.
